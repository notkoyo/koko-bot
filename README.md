# Valorant Custom Game Lobby Discord Bot

## Overview

This Discord bot facilitates the creation and management of custom game lobbies within a Discord server. It allows users to initialize a lobby, create two randomized teams of 5 players, automatically move them into separate voice channels (Attacker/Defender), move all players back to a waiting room, and remove the lobby when it's no longer needed.

### Features

- Initialize a Lobby: Set up a custom game lobby with predefined voice channels.

- Create Randomized Teams: Randomly assign 10 players into two teams (Attacker/Defender).

- Auto-move Players: Automatically move players into their respective team voice channels.

- Move Players to Waiting Room: Move all players back to the waiting room channel.

- Remove Lobby: Delete the custom game lobby from the server.
